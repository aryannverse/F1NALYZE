Here is my EDA project for PBL-1. This project is an EDA based on the 2024 Formula 1 British Grand Prix. 

The Formula 1 Data Analysis and Prediction Model aims to revolutionize decision-making
and strategy formulation in motorsports through the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
and Machine Learning (ML) technologies. This project leverages extensive historical and
real-time telemetry data, encompassing speed, tire wear, fuel efficiency, and weather
conditions, to create predictive models that enhance race strategies, optimize vehicle
performance, and forecast race outcomes.
The methodology involves advanced data preprocessing techniques, including handling
missing values and normalizing datasets, followed by the application of sophisticated ML
algorithms such as Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Support Vector Machines. These
models are trained and evaluated using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to ensure
robustness and accuracy. Simulations play a critical role in testing various race scenarios,
enabling the prediction of race outcomes and the optimization of pit stop strategies and tire
changes.
The project emphasizes data-driven insights, drawing from publicly available historical
Formula 1 data while excluding proprietary telemetry or confidential team strategies.
Computational resources such as GPUs and cloud-based solutions like AWS or GCP facilitate
the efficient processing of large datasets. Visualization tools, including Matplotlib, Seaborn,
and Plotly, are employed to generate static and interactive visual insights, aiding in
exploratory data analysis (EDA).
The expected outcomes include actionable recommendations for enhancing race strategies and
vehicle setups, alongside contributions to the broader research landscape of AI applications in
motorsports. By addressing challenges such as dynamic race conditions and delayed decision-
making, this project underscores the transformative potential of AI/ML in high-stakes
environments like Formula 1 racing, with broader implications for aerospace and automotive
industries.

> I have used mediapipe's hand detection features for placing and sizing magic circles correctly.

> For Images I created a function for replacing blacks pixels with background image.

> If you want to add new magic circle styles all you have to do is create a png.img with black background. After that you are good to go. (you can examine images I used)
