# F1NALYZE
Here is my project for PBL-1. This project is an EDA based on the 2024 Formula 1 British Grand Prix. 

## Objectives of the Project

This project utilizes the power of data science and machine learning in the analysis and prediction of outcomes in Formula 1. Broadly, the main objectives include:

**1. Data Analysis:** Handling, cleaning, and preprocessing historical Formula 1 race data to unveil underlying patterns and insights into race dynamics.
**2. Feature Engineering:** Identifying salient features that might influence race outcomes, like driver skill, team performance, and weather/track characteristics.
**3. Predictive Modeling:** Develop Machine Learning models capable of predicting race winners, fastest laps, and driver standings.
**4. Model Evaluation and Optimization:** Evaluate models and refine them for improved accuracy and identify factors most influencing prediction.
**5. Generation of Insights:** Provide insights into racing strategies in Formula 1 that can be used to help the teams and drivers during races and could eventually even help in understanding race dynamics and strategies.
